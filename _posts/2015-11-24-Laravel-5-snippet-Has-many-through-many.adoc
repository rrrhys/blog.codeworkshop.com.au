# Laravel 5 snippet - Has many through many.

A current project has a requirement that users can share their jobs with other users.

The dummy model is `User->UserWhoHasSharedWithMe->Jobs`

First up is joining the user to those who have shared with them.

The join table has unconventional names, because it's joining the Users table back to itself.

.Table Schema of users_shared_with_users table
|===
|id|shared_from_id|shared_with_id
|===

The following relationship will return a collection of users who have shared their details with me:

    public function UsersWhoHaveSharedWithMe(){
        return $this->belongsToMany(
          'App\User', 
          "users_shared_with_users", 
          "shared_with_id", 
          "shared_from_id"
        );
    }
